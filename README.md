# SRPG-Studio-Translated-Plugins
A Repository of Japanese Plugins for SRPG Studio that have been translated to english, it's meant for plugins made by Japanase Scripters that don't use Github.

Each Japanese author will have their own branch on the repository, to make it easier to track changes and updates to their different scripts and download only the plugins from that author.

Main should remain empty with only this read me to contain a general list of what is in each branch.

Current Branches:

- O-to Plugins
- Namaemitei Plugins
