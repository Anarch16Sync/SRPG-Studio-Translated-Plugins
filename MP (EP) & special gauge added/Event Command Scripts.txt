ーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー
■Ep maximum value change
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChengeMaxEP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  Specify the unit in "Unit" on the "Original data" tab,
  Set the value to be used for addition and subtraction in "Number 1".
  The behavior depending on the value passed to the argument in the code is as follows.
  
  0: Addition
  1: Subtraction
  2: Multiplication
  3: Division
  4: Surplus
  5: Assignment
  
  When used in bases or battle preparations, the current EP will be adjusted to the maximum value.

■Maximum FP value change
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChangeMaxFP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Other settings are the same as changing the EP maximum value.
  Unlike EP, it will not change even if you use it for bases or battle preparations unless the current FP exceeds the maximum value.

■EP current value change
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChangeEP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Other settings are the same as changing the EP maximum value.

■FP current value change
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChangeFP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Other settings are the same as changing the EP maximum value.

■Change the amount of EP recovery per turn
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChangeRecoveryEP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Other settings are the same as changing the EP maximum value.
  *If the recovery amount set for the unit is specified as a percentage,
    It will be a percentage change. (If Recovery:'10%' is specified as an additional value of 5, it will be changed to Recovery:'15%')

■ Change amount of FP recovery per turn
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandChangeRecoveryFP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Other settings are the same as changing the amount of EP recovery per turn.

■Get current EP value
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandGetEP();
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Specify the unit in "Unit" on the "Original data" tab,
  Check "Receive the return value as a variable" on the "Script" tab and specify the variable where it will be stored.

■Get current FP value
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandGetFP();
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Specify the unit in "Unit" on the "Original data" tab,
  Check "Receive the return value as a variable" on the "Script" tab and specify the variable where it will be stored.

■Get maximum EP value
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandGetMaxEP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Specify the unit in "Unit" on the "Original data" tab,
  Check "Receive the return value as a variable" on the "Script" tab and specify the variable where it will be stored.
  
  The behavior depending on the value passed to the argument in the code is as follows.
  0: Get the maximum value set for the unit (value before item and class correction)
  1: Get the maximum value including corrections by item and class

■Get maximum FP value
  Check "Run code" in "Run script" of the event command and write the code.
  
  OT_CommandGetMaxFP(0);
  
  Write it like this.
  
  Specify the unit in "Unit" on the "Original data" tab,
  Check "Receive the return value as a variable" on the "Script" tab and specify the variable where it will be stored.
  
  The behavior depending on the value passed to the argument in the code is as follows.
  0: Get the maximum value set for the unit (value before item and class correction)
  1: Get the maximum value including corrections by item and class
