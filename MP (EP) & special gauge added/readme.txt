  2016/01/06: Prototype creation of MP & special gauge

  2016/01/11：
  Fixed a bug that caused an error when exchanging items with a unit that did not have full inventory.
  Fixed an issue where the motion would go awry during real-time battles when EP/FP was interrupted mid-attack.
  Fixed drawing of EP and FP so that it does not conflict with Mr. CB's class explanation script.
  A simple window that appears when you hover over a unit on the map
  Fixed so that the current EP/FP is displayed.

  2016/04/26:
  Fixed EP and FP constants
  
  2016/06/13：
  Corrected a bug where EP and FP were not consumed when making weapons infinite in the tool user expansion.

  2016/07/31：
  Compatible with 1.086, fixed because initial EP and FP were in the state of 0
  Implemented automatic EP recovery value in unit, class, and item settings.
  Fixed an error in the natural EP recovery value.
  Added processing when you want to implement only EP or FP
(If you only have EP, you can use UnitFP.js. If you only have FP, you can implement only one of them by excluding UnitEP.js.)

  2016/08/22:
  Fixed a bug where the EP and FP of units that became friends through information gathering were set to 0.
  Corrected the class settings so that it can be set to grant a state or die when EP and FP reach a specific range.

  2016/09/18:
  EP consumption and FP consumption can now be set according to movement cost (movement power required to move to that point)
  Images are not cached when drawing windows or gauges,
  Fixed an issue where memory was rapidly accumulating while launching the app.

  2016/10/03:
  Fixed an issue that would occur if the EP and FP were lower than the EP and FP usage of the weapon used after a pursuit.

  2016/10/17:
  Corrected an error caused by a variable error regarding whether or not items can be used.

  *If you have used both MP & special gauge addition and skill activation conditions before 2016/04/26, please be sure to update both when updating.

  2017/05/17:
Fixed an issue where EP and FP were not displayed in the simple window in Ver1.127 or later.
  Corrected the display when specifying negative EP and FP consumption.
  Fixed an issue where FP was not consumed when the EP was lower than the used EP during an attack.
  *Added a description to the readme about when the use of weapons and items is specified as negative.

  2017/05/18:
  Fixed the display of FP consumption and FP recovery as EP~

  2017/06/25:
  Implementation of EP/FP recovery items (revised the one sent for reference in the inquiry on 2016/12/05)

  2018/03/18:
  Added a function to recover EP/FP by actions in battle (attack hit, attack miss, hit, evasion)
  Fixed a bug where FP movement cost was not working properly.

  2019/06/16:
  In the event command "Run Script"
  Changing the maximum value and current value of EP and FP, changing the amount of EP and FP recovered each turn,
  Added a method to get the maximum value and current value of EP and FP

  2020/08/24:
If you do not use EP and only use FP,
  Fixed an issue where an error would occur when deleting UnitEP.js
  (Modified OT_GetUseFP function in UnitFP.js)

  2022/10/22：
  When a weapon has a recovery bonus when taking damage or evading
  Fixed an issue where the opponent would receive a recovery bonus when taking damage and evading in battles using that weapon.
  In FP, it is now possible to set recovery after a turn to start from the second turn.
  (This is possible by setting FirstTurnRecovery of UnitFP.js to false)
  Fixed FP so that it is possible to set the initial FP value at the start of the map for each unit.
  (The initial FP value at the start of the map is the initial value set for the unit + the initial value set for the class.)

  2023/10/29:
  Do not cache maximum EP and maximum FP, EP and FP recovery values ??when displaying the unit menu.
  Fixed a performance problem where each frame was acquired.
  (Because of this, in combination with the addition of skill activation conditions, under certain conditions, the unit menu display became extremely slow.)
  
  Declare constants for maximum EP upper limit and maximum FP upper limit.
  It is declared at the top of UnitEP.js and UnitFP.js to make it easier to change the maximum value.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Instalation method]
Please overwrite the "plugin" and "material" in the folder to the project's "plugin" and "material".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【overview】
By introducing this, ep (mp) and fp (special gauge) will be added to the unit's parameters.
 Additionally, it is now possible to set the remaining amount of EP and FP to be added to the
conditions for determining the use of weapons and items. 
EP is intended to be used in the same way as MP in regular games,
and FP is intended to be used with the premise of charging every turn.

If the installation is successful, ep and fp will be displayed as shown in "Installation screen.jpg".

*Please set the maximum ep and maximum fp parameter limits using global parameters,
 or modify max ep default max in unit ep.js and max fp default max in unit fp.js.
(If a parameter upper limit is set in the class's Custom Parameter, the class's parameter upper limit will take precedence.)
*The maximum value of ep is 30 by default.
*The maximum fp value is 100 by default.

-Caution -
Since the part that is being manipulated is a part,
please be careful when introducing it because if you use it together with a script other than o-to's,
it will easily conflict with the status part script.

-Materials used -
“Gauge.png” and “Gauge2.png” in “Material\OT_AddStatus” are
This is a processed version of SRPG Studio's runtime material.
"window.png" and "window2.png" were created for samples.
--When implementing only one side--
If you do not want to implement Fp, please delete unit fp.js.
If you do not want to implement ep, please delete unit ep.js 
or add $ at the beginning of the file name.

--About changing the current and maximum values ??of ep and fp using event commands--
See "How to use event commands.txt".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【Instructions】
Set custom parameters for units and classes.
(If you can specify a percentage, you can specify the percentage by setting it as '10%' in addition to the numerical value.)

■When changing the window or gauge material, display name, or gauge position

If you want to change the in-game notation or shift the position of the window or gauge,
 change the values ??of ot ep frame setting, ot fp frame setting, and ot energy frame setting in 
 "plugin\ot add status\add status window.js" You can make some adjustments by doing this.
